title: Bitcoin Name Server

This project started as an idea I came with for the [Bitembassy hackathon](hack.bitembassy.org). The
morning of the hackathon, I couldn't find anyone to join me, so I ditched it and joined a different
project. Afterwards I started developing my idea, but it's still very minimal, writing everything in
a day or two.

The main idea is to have something similar to a PGP key server, but for bitcoin addresses. For
example, if a mobile wallet is integrated with this feature, than you could write "@GuySa" or any
other unique ID (email address, etc.) and it will automatically dereference it to my bitcoin
address.

This project is missing a lot. no security measurements were taken into account, for example. this
is just a concept I might improve if I have some free time.
