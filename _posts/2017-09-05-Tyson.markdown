I Help mentor FRC team [Elysium 1937](https://facebook.com/elysium1937). This is the computer vision
we did for the 2017 season. It is written in python with openCV, originally we ran it on a
raspberry pi mounted on our robot with a webcam. I wrote a part of it and the rest was done by the
team. A big part of the work was teaching python and openCV and begging them to use git and work
properly (the begging didn't work).

you can find the source [on github][source code]
